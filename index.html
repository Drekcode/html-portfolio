    <h2>Summary</h2> 
    <p>I am a details person and love making something from scratch. 
        I've only dabbled in programming a few times but since March 2024 I've 
        been taking it more seriously and trying to learn the skill of coding. 
        I have a basic understanding and knowledge of Python, HTML, and CSS. Programming, 
        coding, and web development fascinate me and I want to learn more about them.</p>
